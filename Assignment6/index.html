          <p>In January 2019, Pandya appeared with teammate K. L. Rahul on the show Koffee with Karan, and made several controversial comments 
            which were met with immediate public backlash. During the interview, Pandya spoke about how he had proudly informed his parents of his first sexual encounter, which was well received by them. He also proclaimed that he likes to "observe how women move" at high-end bars and nightclubs, as well as on social media and then went on to liken himself to a black person saying, 
            "I'm a little from the black side so I need to see how they move".</p>

            Pandya played for the Mumbai Indians in the IPL from 2015 to
            2021.Against the Kolkata Knight Riders, in a must-win situation for
            Mumbai Indians to remain in the playoff race, he scored 61 runs off

            Ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction, Pandya was released by the
            Mumbai Indians. He was then drafted by the new Ahmedabad franchise,
            Gujarat Titans, and named captain of the team.He led Gujarat to

            Pandya made his Twenty20 International debut for India on 27 January
            2016 at the age of 22, picking up 2 wickets against Australia.[15]
            His first Twenty20 International wicket was Chris Lynn. In the
            second T20I against Sri Lanka cricket team at Ranchi, he batted
            ahead of Yuvraj Singh and MS Dhoni and hit 27 off 14 balls before
            becoming hat-trick victim of Thisara Perera
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In Asia Cup 2016, Pandya smashed an 18-ball 31 helping India post a
            respectable score against Bangladesh. Later on, he also picked up a
            wicket to secure the win. In the next match against Pakistan he
            bowled his best figures of 3 for 8 which restricted Pakistan to 83.
            In a 2016 World Twenty20 match against Bangladesh on 23 March,
            Pandya took two crucial wickets in the last three balls of match's
            final over as India beat Bangladesh by one run
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            His career best bowling figures of 4 for 38 was achieved in the 3rd
            and final Twenty20 International against England on 8 July 2018, he
            got 33 Not Out in 14 balls, hitting the winning runs with a six off
            Jordan. Hardik became first Indian to take 4 wickets and score above
            30 runs in a T20I in the same match
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            In September 2021, Pandya was named in India's squad for the 2021
            ICC Men's T20 World Cup.However, Pandya failed to make an impact as
            was expected. He scored 11 against Pakistan, which India lost by 10
            wickets. His subsequent innings of 23 against New Zealand did not
            help to further India's cause in the tournament as losing against
            New Zealand meant India crashed out of the World Cup despite winning
            big over inexperienced teams like Afghanistan, Scotland, and
            Namibia. Pandya was picked as an allrounder. However he only bowled
            2 overs against New Zealand without picking any wickets and giving
            away 17 runs. His lack of runs and inability to contribute with the
            ball led to his dropping from the squad for the T20I series that
            followed the World Cup against New Zealand

            Pandya made his One Day International (ODI) debut for India against
            New Zealand on 16 October 2016 at Dharamshala. He became the fourth
            Indian to be named player of the match on ODI debut after Sandeep
            Patil, Mohit Sharma and K. L. Rahul.In his first ODI innings as a
            batsman, he scored 36 runs from 32 balls. In the group stages of ICC
            Champions Trophy, Pandya hit three consecutive sixes off Imad Wasim
            in the same over before rain stopped play. On 18 June 2017, in the
            final of the Champions Trophy at the Oval, he struck a 43-ball 76 in
            a losing cause, after coming in with India at 54/5 following a top
            order collapse.

            played in his 50th ODI.On 17 July 2022, Pandya bowled his ODI
            career-best 4-24 against England in Old Trafford. His 71 runs scored
            during the 2nd innings of the same match made him the first Indian
            player to score a half-century and take 4 wickets in an ODI since
            Yuvraj Singh in 2011.

            injured himself while training in the nets at the PCA Stadium.He was
            named in the squad that toured Sri Lanka in July 2017 and played his
            first Test on 26 July in Galle.In the 3rd and the final Test match
            against Sri Lanka at Pallekele, Pandya scored his maiden Test
            century, and set the record for becoming the first Indian batsman to
            score a Test century just before lunch. He also set the record for
            scoring the most runs in a single over of a Test innings for India,
            scoring 26 runs.This century was his first century in international
            cricket.
